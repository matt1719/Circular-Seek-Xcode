# Circular-Seek-Xcode
This is a circular/radial progress bar written in swift for xcode projects. It was developed for a music application. The circle shows the progress of the song and allows the user to set the progress, so they can seek in the song.

This widget is a view controller so you will have to add it as a child to whatever view controller you plan to use this in.

I think the best part of this implementation is that no matter where you tap within the circular track (edge,center and anywhere inbetween) the gesture will be recognized. I saw some implemntations that required perciese input, mine does not.
